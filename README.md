MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

Overview

This repository contains an implementation of handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning and deep learning models for image classification.

Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of:

Training Set: 60,000 images

Test Set: 10,000 images

Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9). The dataset is available in TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch libraries, or can be downloaded from LeCun's official website.
